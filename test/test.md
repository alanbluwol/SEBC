This is just plain text.

Below is a snippet of code:

```sh
wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-java-5.1.41.tar.gz
tar -zxvf mysql-connector-java-5.1.41.tar.gz
mkdir -p /usr/share/java/
cp mysql-connector-java-5.1.41/mysql-connector-java-5.1.41-bin.jar /usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar

```

This is a list:

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.
